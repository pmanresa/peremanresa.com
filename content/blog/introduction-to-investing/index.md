Topics to cover that are worth having a section:

- Regulations
  - EU's Packaged Retail Investment and Insurance Products (PRIIPs) guideline
  - UCITS
- Insurances
  - Investor Compensation Schemes
  - Deposit Insurance
- Fund Domicile
- Suitable Index Funds for Europeans

Interested in knowing more about the requirements for a fund to be awarded with the UCITS badge? This [article](https://www.justetf.com/de/news/etf/legal-structure-of-etfs-ucits.html) from justETF is an excellent read.

This is another sentence with `inline-code` in it. Let's see `how that looks` ?

```python
def function(x):
  """ this is a python function """
  return x ** 2

[lambda x: function(x) for i in range(10)]
```
